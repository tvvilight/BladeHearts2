# ❤️ BladeHearts Plugin (BETA) ❤️

Welcome to **BladeHearts**, a powerful and customizable Minecraft plugin that lets you grant players extra permanent hearts using enchanted heart items! This is the **BETA snapshot release**, and it's just the beginning! 🚀

## 🔥 Features
- 💖 `/bh give <player> <type> <amount>` command to grant special heart items
- ❤️ Currently available heart type: `standard`
  - ✨ Each `standard` heart permanently adds **+1** heart to the player's health when used
- 🌱 More heart types, effects, and visual polish coming soon!

> ⚠️ This version is in **beta**, so things might change — expect updates and improvements based on your feedback!

## 🛠️ Command Usage

`/bh give <player> <type> <amount>`

- **player** – The target player
- **type** – The heart type (currently only `standard`)
- **amount** – Number of heart items to give

### Example:
/bh give wolnefury standard 3
This will give **3 enchanted red heart items** to player `wolnefury`.

## 🧪 Installation

2. Restart or reload the server
3. Start giving hearts to your fav players 🥹💕

## 📦 Roadmap (Coming Soon)
